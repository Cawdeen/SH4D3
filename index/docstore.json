The original location of the city was located East of Mos Eisley near the Jedi shrine at 5958 -5685.\n\u2022 In an effort to be more convenient and increase recruiting, the town was relocated to an open valley West of Bestine near -2300 -3400 in January 2022 (and was moved again for growth later).\n\u2022 The renewed focus of the city was to be a place where anyone could place their vendor and be a 'Bazaar' for the entire Galaxy. Although the idea attracted some interest, never fully caught on.\n\u2022 After recruiting for a few months, the town finally reached Tier 4 shuttle status in late March 2022.\n\u2022 In April 2022 the Freetown Republic <FTOWN> guild was formed for residents of the town as a neutral guild and began recruiting.\n\u2022 Residents voted to relocate the city in May 2022 due to expansion restrictions in the previous location and began transitioning to Jabba's Canyon near -6666 -4868\n\u2022 In June 2022 the guild rebranded from Freetown Republic to an underworld-themed syndicate called the Tempest Trading Company.\n\u2022 In June 2022 also the Oo'tu clan joined Tempest and started an outpost city on Talus near Dearic called Tranquility. They gained Metropolis status in July\n\u2022 In August Tempest branded three divisions for crafting (Shadow Market), space (Reaper Fleet), and ground (Black Sand Mercenaries)\n\u2022 In December Mos Pelgo hosted the first Tempest Tournament featuring 1v1 dueling and topping off with an Imperial invasion, Darth Vader, and the destruction of the town by an ISD\n\u2022 In March 2023 Mos Pelgo was largely filled up and the crew decided to expand near home base into the Pelgo Slums immediately next to Jabba's Palace.\n\n============================\n**Layout of Mos Pelgo**\n\nDescription:\nMos Pelgo is located on Tattooine at the Southwest corner of the map in The Valley of the Wind. The buildings are round and dome shaped and the color of sand. The town is surrounded by steep cliffs and hills to the north, west, and east, and has some sloped hills leading into the dunes to the south.\nThe main road of the town runs north-south with houses lined on either side. \n\nLocations of places in Mos Pelgo:\nThe shuttleport is located right in the center of town. To the east of the shuttleport is The Spice Rack, Tempest's guild hall. To the west of the shuttleport is The Shadow Market, our mall and shops.\nThrough the center of town running down the center of the main road is number of gardens. SH4D3 helps with maintaining the plants in these gardens, but the gardens are really a town effort and everyone lends a hand.\nOff the main road through town is a number of small side streets with residences. Some people have shops or vendors in their personal structures. Since Mos Pelgo is an underworld town its possible there are some seedy buildings with secret things happening that the Empire would not be happy about.\nThere is a bank in the main road, just south of the shuttleport.\nThere is a garage for repairing vehicles and speeders next to the bank in the main road.\nThe Ootini new player market, the jawa market, is right in fron of the shuttleport.\nThe cloning facility, or cloner, is to the north west of the shuttle on the other side of city hall.\nPelgo Slums is a few hundred meters directly south of Mos Pelgo, next to Jabba's Palace. You can see Pelgo Slums from the small hill at the south side of town if you look towards Jabba's Palace.\n\nAbout vendors and shops in the Shadow Market\n\nFront section:\nIn the front of the shadow market by the door are some junk vendors. You can find looted items, slicing components, and junk here.\nThe front counters have some droid vendors, artisan supplies, and Destalv architect vendors.

If you're looking for a place to hide out, you may have found the just right place. We live in the shadow of Jabba's Palace in an area known as the Valley of the Wind -where we got our namesake: **Tempest** (a violent wind storm). \n\nThe **Tempest Trading Co.** is an underworld umbrella syndicate for our three Divisions:\n\n\u2022 the **Tempest Corsairs** (<#960665518161924156>) which has enlisted some of the best pilots in the galaxy fighting in deep space or working on their latest RE project.\n\n\u2022 the **Black Sand Mercenaries** (<#992081582590541825>) (Ground Combat) stirring up trouble engaging in the GCW, Invasions, PvP, or hosting guild spins and PvE group content.\n\n\u2022 the **Shadow Crafters** (<#949865856765153290>) and the famous Shadow Market home to established traders, open to all member vendors, and assisting the latest up and coming brands\n\n**Cities:** Our headquarters is located in Mos Pelgo & the Pelgo Slums on Tatooine near Jabba\u2019s Palace. SoloWest is the mayor of Mos Pelgo and Vamidri is the mayor of the Pelgo Slums. \n\n**GCW:** We are technically neutral aligned, however, the cities are sanctuary to a heavy Rebel presence in the Galactic Civil War. The underworld is accepting of all factions, but you never know when your friends may come to hunt you down.\n\n**Communication:** We are most active in-game during evenings US time zones, but we chat continuously throughout the day. We speak English in all guild and game chat. Most folks prefer to chat in Discord, but do some in-game guild chat and occasional Voice for events and whatnot. \n\nDon\u2019t be shy -please speak up and ask questions. It\u2019s the best way to get to know the gang and integrate yourself with the crew. A lot of us like to chat & help even when we aren't playing!\n\n**Events:** We generally plan to do a couple events per week and use the Discord Events feature to organize in advance (note this displays the time in *your* time zone). We thrive when -and highly encourage- guild members create their own events and bring the group together.\n\n**Culture:** The feel of the guild is generally casual, collaborative, and drama free. Keep in mind we are playing a 20-year old game -- let's be supportive and have a good time together!\n\nAt times we may be a bit rough around the edges for some folks, but in general we try to be a positive influence on the community. Tempest has very few rules but expect folks to abide by the SWGR Community Standards.\n\nTo sum up - we are a chill, casual community enjoying the ride.

We strive to be a positive and helpful community of players having fun \ud83d\ude42\n\u2022 The original location of the city was located East of Mos Eisley near the Jedi shrine at 5958 -5685.\n\u2022 In an effort to be more convenient and increase recruiting, the town was relocated to an open valley West of Bestine near -2300 -3400 in January 2022 (was moved again for growth later).\n\u2022 The renewed focus of the city was to be a place where anyone could place their vendor and be a 'Bazaar' for the entire Galaxy. Although the idea attracted some interest, never fully caught on.\n\u2022 After recruiting for a few months, the town finally reached Tier 4 shuttle status in late March 2022.\n\u2022 In April 2022 the Freetown Republic <FTOWN> guild was formed for residents of the town as a neutral guild and began recruiting.\n\u2022 Residents voted to relocate the city in May 2022 due to expansion restrictions in the previous location and began transitioning to Jabba's Canyon near -6666 -4868\n\u2022 In June 2022 the guild rebranded from Freetown Republic to the underworld-themed Tempest Trading Company.\n\u2022 In June 2022 also the Oo'tu clan joined Tempest and started an outpost city on Talus near Dearic called Tranquility. They gained Metropolis status in July\n\u2022 In August Tempest branded three divisions for crafting (Shadow Market), space (Reaper Fleet), and ground (Black Sand Mercenaries)\n\n================================\n**CRAFTING & TRADE GUIDELINES**\n\n**Crafting & Vendors**\n\u2022 Anybody may place a vendor in the Shadow Mall. Room shall be made for that to happen. Individual house stores and tents are also of course allowed.\n\u2022 The citifies desire to have vendors with high-stocking rates with a wide variety of goods so the city gets a reputations of always having what players want.\n\u2022 As such, to enable high stocking rates and variety, I tend to encourage there being multiple crafters in the same space collaborating to some degree.\n\u2022 However, for folks in the same crafting space, alignment on pricing is required so as not to undermine each other.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f292c2c-979e-40c3-a06b-68246e0f4c68": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f292c2c-979e-40c3-a06b-68246e0f4c68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d63a0a64-59db-4b4a-8f38-a21c3952d829", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e47736b2ec3402dc51f443b2687de6abfe8ec1d9f59f4ba25a66029648a387f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d0bb98f-2072-4c9b-a96b-d63b8a415a9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d562b4f89d0ab2821e888485d451ec267caf8659b771490bad2cc694a475dc7"}}, "hash": "bc3d6c500046ad40a96798b4bd52c336facb4e3c5a35fa4e166e0c23e0cbd3da", "text": "**Vendor & Service List:**\nPlease fill out this to list your vendor with a description of your shop goods:\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zwupLDcL8150Lgecyt60p4MLBUTkTG65LCO9SA_bUnw/edit>\n\n**General Crafting Ideas:**\nJust a working document with various crafting professions with categories of goods & services:\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JSZr5XjQmIjw1kVMLxoydmrimYmEwcY44zCwAixwS8E/edit>\n\n================================\n\nList of Guild members and accomplices:\n\nBlack Krrsantan: Big scary Wookie, rebel, melee fighter\nRevenant: Rebel fighter, ranged weapons, wears a Mandalorian helmet\nStrysen Irristay\nCelestiel Veil\nItege\nKirfa Igek\nRumakai\nKeer Tregga\nTrenn' Volta\nKarpm\nShintu Felper\nBarsh Ban'Tamo\nRevekk\nDetox Etith\nVamidri Neogrohe: Part of the Mos Pelgo militia, professions: commando and combat medic, rebel aligned in the galactice civil war\nEponine N'tarra\nKezith Ferrokage\nOlecram DeLeon\nMaxal Aylor\nRainbow Six: Smuggler, uses a pistol, rebel, kills a lot of Imps\nSylus\nConnie\nRevaa\nEmryssa Embries\nMalic Pumowaig\nUw-Da Sacijou\nTerga Tone\nDrait Kalmanda\nI'adri Edivo\nKorynn Gundon: Armorsmith\nIrai\nAvyd Aned\nEagim Beapit\nMilkyway\nVeshkar\nAstro Nautics: Species is Ithorian, a shipwright by trade, fancy dresser\nRiles\nTraise\nSpatium\nTarisa Destalv\nAg'athon\nRoslin\nTasya\nSnailey Mando: Feared bounty hunter, has a nack for sneaking into locked homes\nRuinousx\nKedof\nKyana\nOdiwan\nIndigo SoloWest\ndbbubba rage\nXboxer dbb\nMarshall SoloWest: Guild leader\nEdison SoloWest: Best ranged weaponsmith in the galaxy\nAdrianne Darkcloud\nMalrath Crowe\nClarissa Dechien\nOogie Boogie\nAriana' Grande\nTigers Submariner\nETCM Submariner\nGeaux Submariner\nSeungwan Starrider\nNature'Made\nFilo Gwonkwun\nVenarte Pyros\nMelack\nPhilosophy N'tarra\nCosette N'tarra\nBlack-Krrsantan\nMiranda Dechien\nDarshin Caldeira\nIzzak Felper\nWraith\nEcksar Bodean\nSamahria Darkcloud\nSerinda Brinsbane\nLochinvar\nRuple: Currently a tailor, used to be a weaponsmith, Mayor of Pelgo Slums\nCasey'Leon Ambraelle\nDawha\nChalurra\nBis Cuit\nMinami Gho\nGraar\nAupeu\nBadhe Ause'Es\nTristin Aepi\nBlasphemy\nVentus Pyros\nCeibros de'Ikarus", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9805e19-db3c-4571-93cb-c156ebbcfcfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9805e19-db3c-4571-93cb-c156ebbcfcfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4027bda5-dac1-4063-b9f6-7ad66e9b83b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5cd8972e05402b3db605c35c7d2c04361b8e712825dc4bd030f29a6e885670ac"}}, "hash": "1714621f9515986dbeac5afeabc62e132b2265cc6c0eb17250505ace9d9c62e1", "text": "How the Pelgo Slums came to be:\n\nOnce a quiet and unremarkable town on the desert planet of Tatooine, Mos Pelgo had become a hotbed of activity in recent years. Its population had grown to a boiling point, overflowing with merchants, smugglers, mercenaries, and spice dealers. The town had become a hub for bounty hunters, and murders in the main street had become a common site. Mos Pelgo had long been a covert refuge for the notorious Tempest Trading Company, which often engaged in illicit activities. Yet, the surge in criminal activities within the town had reached a tipping point, impeding the smooth running of business.\n\nThe increased activity had not gone unnoticed by the powers that be and the regional governor of the Tatooine system had taken notice. Even the Notorious Jabba the Hutt had taken issue with the prominence of the city, even declaring in a private meeting with the City\u2019s mayor, Marshall Solowest, that all the new attention was bad for business and the relationship between the Hutts and Mos Pelgo might suffer as a result. The meeting was tense and both the Black Sand Mercenaries and Jabba\u2019s henchmen seemed ready to draw blasters at a moments notice.\n\nIn an effort to calm tensions the mayor ordered the Black Sand Mercenaries to raid a few structures in the seediest part of town, hoping to put a dent in the growing unsanctioned criminal activity\u2026 \n\nThe raids were mostly successful, but they had unintended consequences. Many of the displaced criminals had started to form a small neighborhood just outside of Mos Pelgo in the shadow of Jabba\u2019s Palace, seeking shelter from the raids that had plagued their operations in Pelgo. The locals began to call it the \"Pelgo Slums,\" a playful yet fitting name for the ramshackle settlement.\n\nAs the twin suns set over the Valley of the Winds and its outlying neighborhoods, the new slums slowly came alive with the humming sound of a few rusty equipment factories, some vendors hawking their wares, and the occasional scuffle breaking out between rival factions. Meanwhile, the rest of Mos Pelgo went about its business, with some business owners even making light of the new settlement.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6822615e-1e1d-4c9e-a7e6-091c7f70fdbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "6822615e-1e1d-4c9e-a7e6-091c7f70fdbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5334b03-58f8-4e58-b8f7-60f19b487607", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3dbed2f13e246d1a341083fb0383939832522ac4acc438793ae4d614a04278f8"}, "3": {"node_id": "5fc42231-ce67-482b-ac97-88d6d24da40b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2545063bf9a4144044315f4aa6f6911785dcd617e54003224e61e48e7f8e3d8a"}}, "hash": "bd11b629b9a0277bb9e0a1b15975bc1f46f90ccca469f40628808d2e28e52f7b", "text": "The Restoration server features a completely new unlock system for the Jedi profession.\nFuture Force-Sensitive Initiates will take part in a storyline that is tied to their unlock progression.\n\nAnyone can become a Jedi, even crafters and entertainers.\n\n\nDeveloper Q&A\u200b\n\"A is structured like this: It requires doing A, B and C things for everyone.

(Worried that a character not intending to become a Jedi ends up being the one that has the inciting event.)\n\nAnswer: You can have multiple characters on your account that are Force Sensitive. But you can only have one Jedi. The inciting incident does not make your character a Jedi. It starts your journey towards Force Sensitivity and you can later elect to become a Jedi after multiple phases, at which point you would lock your other characters from advancing further.\n\nQuestion: Since I haven\u2019t seen this answered anywhere else I might as well ask\u2026 How will Jedi interact with space? Will a death in space cost a Jedi life? Will jedi be perma-overt in space? Will you be able to fly a ship or board a pob as a ghost?\n\nAnswer: Death in Space will cost Jedi a life. Jedi will be overt in Space consistent with our existing explanation of the TEF and PEF systems, respectively. Jedi cannot enter Space while a ghost at this time but this may change in the future as the features are expanded.\n\nQuestion: will the \"death counter\" be like pre-cu where you could bypass it with something like the hero of tattooine ring?\n\nAnswer: No. There is no way to bypass the death counter. Question: but why the lack of permadeath? Answer: We don't believe perma-death makes sense mechanically or in context. At the end of the day, players will spend hundreds of hours to unlock and train in the skills of a Force Sensitive/Jedi, and permanently taking that away serves no purpose but to punish players and discourage them from fully playing the game due to the constant overarching fear of losing their character they've worked so hard to attain. We balance this with the lives system we've talked a bit about already to ensure there is still a death penalty and we can control the overall population of Jedi on the server at once.\n\nQuestion: If a player unlocks on a crafter for FS crafting, but has no intention of any combat, is this person part of the active pool of \u2018Jedi\u2019 that can be up at any one time? Are they going to clog up the turnover on the queue system? Will they get murdered while sitting making their widgets of choice? Can you craft while blue glowy?\n\nAnswer: Force Sensitive is different from Jedi. When we say Jedi in describing mechanics, we mean Jedi, that is, a Jedi Padawan or higher. If we mean Force Sensitive we will say that, as we\u2019re very intentionally distinguishing the two. And no, you cannot craft while a Force Ghost (\u201cblue glowly\u201d).\n\nQuestion: Can I ask what \"playing the game\" means when people like Dom are equally clueless about the next step?

You basically have to perform a certain action to incite but there are a lot of variables* as to when this gets triggered such as planet and night/day. Completely down to luck and being in the right place at the right time doing the right thing.\" - Banth\n\nDeveloper view on the Inciting Incident:\n\"The Inciting Incident system was created to address the challenge of balancing the immersion of the original Star Wars timeline with the desire to incorporate Jedi as a significant aspect of the game. In the timeline of the game, there weren't any Jedi around searching out younglings, and anyone knowledgeable enough to recognize it in you early on was being silenced by the Empire. Our solution was to develop a system that aligns with the lore, while also allowing us to regulate how frequently players can access Jedi.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "278383b8-6329-4740-9864-780cfa808161": {"__data__": {"id_": "278383b8-6329-4740-9864-780cfa808161", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5334b03-58f8-4e58-b8f7-60f19b487607", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3dbed2f13e246d1a341083fb0383939832522ac4acc438793ae4d614a04278f8"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ed188e4-2165-4f42-88bc-7aad43ceef84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "17d26400080dcadfb9a845762fb85515cd5ca4875d01302d4ac21bde8a937c38"}, "3": {"node_id": "ac6994c5-1c9d-4f2d-a90a-dc1c8975eb49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1255842d963f08a16f4e088a5eb99a58ab3310b589393da3c4744f3a61279792"}}, "hash": "293fb371d56b6dbc58ee57043af0b1e184e5742c6c0394a3c10388ef3b1115fa", "text": "We don't view Jedi as an entitlement that any player can achieve, to ensure that it maintains its unique and significant place in the game.

However, there are a few tips that may prove useful.\nTo have the possibility of rolling an Inciting incident, your character has to be 10 days old.\nInciting Incident resets every 28-31 days.\nInciting Incident can occur in space and on any planet, including Mustafar and Kashyyyk.\nYour currently mastered Professions will influence the Inciting Incident. It is no longer possible for a Combat character to have a Crafting-related Inciting Incident.\nHowever, there are social and other \"general\" incites that anyone can have. More information on those is in the\n\"List of Possible Inciting Incidents\" section of the wiki.\n\"Each inciting incident now has an associated probability such that there is chance in whether or not the activity itself triggers the incite regardless of having met the other confounding variables.\nFor example, if your inciting incident is to change the control of a factional zone, because this is a rarer activity, we've set a much higher probability to achieving the incite, whereas if your inciting incident is to chat with another player, the probability would be very low because that is a very common activity.\nThis chance does not affect the other variables (e.g., the factional status of a character needing to be X) at the time the incident is triggered.\" - Aconite\nNeutral players can have Inciting Incident as well, read the following quote:\n\"A new insight on inciting: We've previously shared that faction plays a role in unlock, but many have questioned how that works if you aren't a declared faction.

Consequently, the process of becoming a Jedi will be a demanding, stimulating, and individualized experience for every inhabitant of the Star Wars Galaxy. Discovery of The Force will require exploration throughout the ground and space on group and solo adventures. Everything encountered along the way, from artifacts and horticulture to creatures and conclaves, will play a role in your saga.\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to share unlocking Jedi will take place over 6 phases, featuring unique unlock mechanics, completely new and custom storylines and content, as well as original functionality and utility for the profession as a whole.

This specific moment of discovery, different for every being, is precipitated when you need it most and denotes the start of a new journey towards the force.\n\nPhase 1: Insights From the Development Team:\u200b\n\nOne of the challenges posed by our timeline during the era of the Galactic Civil War is that there are not any forms of order and structure to discovering force sensitive younglings, making it likely many would go into their adulthood without knowing they were force sensitive. Where moments in their life were more likely to be seen as a lucky guess or correct decision, they were really indicative of force sensitivity. It isn\u2019t until some moment in time that demands they call upon powers they didn\u2019t even know they had, such as Rey finding the Lightsaber (discovery) or Grogu and The Mudhorn (danger), triggers an epiphany that there is more to them than they know.\n\nHow this translates to the game more specifically is that each character will have a unique moment that will act as their inciting incident. There are more than 50 possible base incident types when, if triggered, you\u2019ll call upon the force for help (for example, finding a special object, being close to death, healing someone, dodging a missile in space, or lucky experimentation with crafting) that could be your inciting incident multiplied by other confounding variables which make thousands of unique possibilities for what the inciting incident for each character you have might be. Once you encounter your inciting incident, you\u2019ll move forward to the procuring proclivity phase.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously noted that certain aspects of character progression already achieved by players, such as meeting certain accomplishments will be retroactively credited towards a character\u2019s unlock journey. This remains the case, however, the inciting incident will be a unique start to the unlock journey that will only be available to trigger once 1.0 is released. Players will have an in-game means to track their progress towards unlock which we\u2019ll share more about in a future Developer Diary.\n\nHow \u201cunique\u201d will the Jedi unlock process be?\u200b\nThere are components of the unlock process that will be unique to the extent that it is possible only 1 in 5000 players will experience exactly the same event sequence. Other components will be exactly the same for everyone. The biggest places of variance will be in the inciting incident and subsequent phases, as well as your larger storyline path based on your choices towards the light or dark side of the force, which we expand on a bit more later.\nHow will you limit the population of Jedi so that the server does not become overrun with Jedi which isn\u2019t fictionally realistic or fun?\nThere are three primary mechanisms that limit the population of Jedi:\nUnlock Randomization - Because unlocking Jedi is not a uniform experience for every player, and because there is significant randomization in the requisites to unlock, players cannot easily identify a consistent path to becoming a Jedi.\nUnlock Gating - Different phases of the unlock process have time and place gating that require additional playtime and/or play locations and content playthrough so it won\u2019t be possible to make a linear advancement to complete the unlock process quickly.\nRe-Entry Gating - After death, Jedi become Force Ghosts and aren\u2019t able to immediately resume combat or other non-social aspects of the game. For more information on this mechanic, see \u201cWhat happens when a Jedi dies and how do lives work?\u201d\nWhat is Jedi Visibility and how does it work?\u200b\nA Jedi can become \u201cvisible\u201d if they engage in factional PvP or if they are observed by NPCs in the world doing anything that would raise suspicion about their force sensitivity, such as using force powers or wielding a lightsaber.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b1020eb-7fd7-4e97-bded-bfe168ce2ac4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b1020eb-7fd7-4e97-bded-bfe168ce2ac4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5334b03-58f8-4e58-b8f7-60f19b487607", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3dbed2f13e246d1a341083fb0383939832522ac4acc438793ae4d614a04278f8"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac6994c5-1c9d-4f2d-a90a-dc1c8975eb49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1255842d963f08a16f4e088a5eb99a58ab3310b589393da3c4744f3a61279792"}}, "hash": "d0e9a9c694e0d0fa6b43056d1c524d0ea86f5fa0f129e925c49b97fd4e99b197", "text": "Depending on the friendliness of the area and the about of visibility you have, the NPCs may take a variety of actions, such as attacking you, creating a bounty against you, adding a Temporary Enemy Flag against you, or even calling Lord Vador\u2019s Inquisitors to capture or kill you.\n\nVisibility will decay over time while a Jedi is online and is either behaving incognito while in front of others or who has reclused away from municipalities until rumors of their presence have dissipated.\n\nCan Jedi just hide in private structures if they become visible and have a TEF or active bounty?\u200b\nJedi will have a variety of abilities to evade detection and reduce their visibility should they be in danger. Nevertheless, highly skilled Bounty Hunters will also have tools and resources to track down a structure where a Jedi may be hiding and, with the help of other professions, may break into or draw the Jedi out of such places.\n\nHow will Temporary and Permanent Enemy Flagging (TEF/PEF) work for Jedi?\u200b\nA Temporary Enemy Flag (\u201cTEF\u201d) is a relationship between a player and one or more players/entities that makes them attackable in Player versus Player (PvP) combat. For example, player bounties create a temporary enemy flag between the Bounty Hunter and the Target Player.\n\nA player may advance through the Force Sensitive and Jedi Padawan profession trees before any changes to TEF logic will apply. However, once a player elects to become a Jedi Knight, they will move from temporary to permanent enemy flagging (PEF), which means they will always be overt and attackable in a Player versus Player context, regardless of if they have triggered any temporary flagging logic.\n\nWho can attack Jedi when they have a TEF/PEF?\u200b\nWhen a Jedi becomes a Jedi Knight, they will elect a faction, and their corresponding factional identity (Rebel or Imperial) will control who they become flagged as an enemy to (that of the opposing faction).\n\nWhat are Jedi Lives and what happens when a Jedi dies?\u200b\nJedi will have a number of lives assigned to them. For example, a Jedi Knight may have five lives. Once the Jedi Knight has died five times, they will become a Force Ghost and unable to engage in combat or any other character mechanics, limiting their in-game engagement to only social interactions with others.\n\nForce Ghosts, while online, will enter a global queue to request to return to a normal Jedi status. To exit the queue, they must satisfy two conditions: (1) a global cooldown period which changes based on the playtime and rank of the Jedi, as well as (2) a global limitation on the number of Jedi who can be alive and active in the galaxy at once.
