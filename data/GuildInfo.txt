**Guild & Mos Pelgo History:**

• Mos Pelgo was founded in November 2021. The original location of the city was located East of Mos Eisley near the Jedi shrine at 5958 -5685.
• In an effort to be more convenient and increase recruiting, the town was relocated to an open valley West of Bestine near -2300 -3400 in January 2022 (and was moved again for growth later).
• The renewed focus of the city was to be a place where anyone could place their vendor and be a 'Bazaar' for the entire Galaxy. Although the idea attracted some interest, never fully caught on.
• After recruiting for a few months, the town finally reached Tier 4 shuttle status in late March 2022.
• In April 2022 the Freetown Republic <FTOWN> guild was formed for residents of the town as a neutral guild and began recruiting.
• Residents voted to relocate the city in May 2022 due to expansion restrictions in the previous location and began transitioning to Jabba's Canyon near -6666 -4868
• In June 2022 the guild rebranded from Freetown Republic to an underworld-themed syndicate called the Tempest Trading Company.
• In June 2022 also the Oo'tu clan joined Tempest and started an outpost city on Talus near Dearic called Tranquility. They gained Metropolis status in July
• In August Tempest branded three divisions for crafting (Shadow Market), space (Reaper Fleet), and ground (Black Sand Mercenaries)
• In December Mos Pelgo hosted the first Tempest Tournament featuring 1v1 dueling and topping off with an Imperial invasion, Darth Vader, and the destruction of the town by an ISD
• In March 2023 Mos Pelgo was largely filled up and the crew decided to expand near home base into the Pelgo Slums immediately next to Jabba's Palace.

============================
**Layout of Mos Pelgo**

Description:
Mos Pelgo is located on Tattooine at the Southwest corner of the map in The Valley of the Wind. The buildings are round and dome shaped and the color of sand. The town is surrounded by steep cliffs and hills to the north, west, and east, and has some sloped hills leading into the dunes to the south.
The main road of the town runs north-south with houses lined on either side. 

Locations of places in Mos Pelgo:
The shuttleport is located right in the center of town. To the east of the shuttleport is The Spice Rack, Tempest's guild hall. To the west of the shuttleport is The Shadow Market, our mall and shops.
Through the center of town running down the center of the main road is number of gardens. SH4D3 helps with maintaining the plants in these gardens, but the gardens are really a town effort and everyone lends a hand.
Off the main road through town is a number of small side streets with residences. Some people have shops or vendors in their personal structures. Since Mos Pelgo is an underworld town its possible there are some seedy buildings with secret things happening that the Empire would not be happy about.
There is a bank in the main road, just south of the shuttleport.
There is a garage for repairing vehicles and speeders next to the bank in the main road.
The Ootini new player market, the jawa market, is right in fron of the shuttleport.
The cloning facility, or cloner, is to the north west of the shuttle on the other side of city hall.
Pelgo Slums is a few hundred meters directly south of Mos Pelgo, next to Jabba's Palace. You can see Pelgo Slums from the small hill at the south side of town if you look towards Jabba's Palace.

** About Tempest Trading Co, aka SHADE, aka <SHADE> **

Welcome scoundrel! If you're looking for a place to hide out, you may have found the just right place. We live in the shadow of Jabba's Palace in an area known as the Valley of the Wind -where we got our namesake: **Tempest** (a violent wind storm). 

The **Tempest Trading Co.** is an underworld umbrella syndicate for our three Divisions:

• the **Tempest Corsairs** (<#960665518161924156>) which has enlisted some of the best pilots in the galaxy fighting in deep space or working on their latest RE project.

• the **Black Sand Mercenaries** (<#992081582590541825>) (Ground Combat) stirring up trouble engaging in the GCW, Invasions, PvP, or hosting guild spins and PvE group content.

• the **Shadow Crafters** (<#949865856765153290>) and the famous Shadow Market home to established traders, open to all member vendors, and assisting the latest up and coming brands

**Cities:** Our headquarters is located in Mos Pelgo & the Pelgo Slums on Tatooine near Jabba’s Palace. SoloWest is the mayor of Mos Pelgo and Vamidri is the mayor of the Pelgo Slums. 

**GCW:** We are technically neutral aligned, however, the cities are sanctuary to a heavy Rebel presence in the Galactic Civil War. The underworld is accepting of all factions, but you never know when your friends may come to hunt you down.

**Communication:** We are most active in-game during evenings US time zones, but we chat continuously throughout the day. We speak English in all guild and game chat. Most folks prefer to chat in Discord, but do some in-game guild chat and occasional Voice for events and whatnot. 

Don’t be shy -please speak up and ask questions. It’s the best way to get to know the gang and integrate yourself with the crew. A lot of us like to chat & help even when we aren't playing!

**Events:** We generally plan to do a couple events per week and use the Discord Events feature to organize in advance (note this displays the time in *your* time zone). We thrive when -and highly encourage- guild members create their own events and bring the group together.

**Culture:** The feel of the guild is generally casual, collaborative, and drama free. Keep in mind we are playing a 20-year old game -- let's be supportive and have a good time together!

At times we may be a bit rough around the edges for some folks, but in general we try to be a positive influence on the community. Tempest has very few rules but expect folks to abide by the SWGR Community Standards.

To sum up - we are a chill, casual community enjoying the ride. Star Wars Galaxies is best when playing with a group of buddies. Welcome to the crew 😈

About <NEXUS>

The Separatist Alliance, or NEXUS, or Nexus, is a Rebel PvP and GCW Guild led by Telrain Cosmar. 

This Guild was essentially split off from but partnered with **<SHADE>** to keep PvP and non-PvP at arm's length from each other but still within reach. Both Guilds are housed in this Discord but under a separate category. 

Due to sensitive planning discussions, these channels are locked by default. If you are at all interested in Rebel PvP and the GCW please reach out to Telrain or SoloWest for access. 

==============================

**Tempest Expectations**

• **No Drama** - It’s a 20yo game let’s make it enjoyable for ourselves and others. Tempest is a positive open community focused on having a good time. Guild members and friends of Guild members are welcome.

• **Help!** As you get established, start paying it forward. Assist with that Ace mission, donate to the Spice Rack, answer questions... Go out of your way to make someone’s day!

• **Participate** However you can. Whatever that looks like for you. Setting up and attending events and adventures, starting a business for the Shadow Market, or just posting memes and chit chatting.

• **Rules?** The Underworld doesn’t have many rules but goes without saying no bigotry, discrimination, illegal or anything along those lines. Please follow all Discord and SWGR terms of service and community guidelines.

**CRAFTING & TRADE GUIDELINES**

**Crafting & Vendors**
• Anybody may place a vendor in the Shadow Mall. Room shall be made for that to happen. Individual house stores and tents are also of course allowed.
• The citifies desire to have vendors with high-stocking rates with a wide variety of goods so the city gets a reputations of always having what players want.
• As such, to enable high stocking rates and variety, I tend to encourage there being multiple crafters in the same space collaborating to some degree.
• However, for folks in the same crafting space, alignment on pricing is required so as not to undermine each other.
