Morning Brief - Announcements and Events

Here are the announcements from the announcements channel:

SoloWest (Marshall, Indigo) says: 
Evening <@&1093044085222277190> 

Wanted to give a little update on a few things as we close in on the end of October. 

OOC, the SoloWest clan has been busy with sick kiddos and doing all things ðŸŽƒ as we start getting into the holiday season. 

IC, you may have seen the SoloWest gang muddling around town doing crafting or some random farming. Marshall has been participating in the GCW as well for the Rebels trying not to die ðŸ¤£

**Pelgo Cities** - Wanted to update everyone on city status. So Mos Pelgo is at 41/40 to keep Metropolis. I typically like to see it at 43+ so could use some citizens. If needed I can advertise for the city. Several great spots near the shuttle or in the back of the house if you have an extra toon. The Pelgo Slums is at a comfortable 36/30 to keep the shuttle and is a great convenient spot as well! Contact <@&1097381934113488936>  for help. 

**Roles**
Added a few roles you can tag yourself in. Time zones should help people be aware of availability a bit more. Corrected the city roles. Also adding a Roleplay tag shortly. https://discord.com/channels/941946604309594142/1060430010218979459/1163683692636549120

**Sunday Theme Parks** - Last month we did Quarantine Zone Theme Park night on Sundays and was pretty fun. Wanting to keep that up so was going to set up some Witches of Dathomir nights to continue the trend. 

**Events**
Been loving to see events pop up on this Discord. Please if you want to do something add an event. Super cool Great Hunt events by Empyrs, Billie has been doing Space collections, got some Ryatt Trail runsâ€¦ Keep it coming!!!

**Tempest Gunship**
Had the maiden voyage of the Co-Defendant Gunship a few weeks ago. Keer was a little under the weather but we plan to start up a ~weekly event soon for space xp gain, loot, or collections.  


**Shadow Market**
As always I am looking for as many crafters as I can get my hands on. My hope has always been to have Pelgo and the Shadow Market be a top shopping destination. I make crafter SEA suits for guild members for essentially free and have tens of millions of resource Iâ€™ll probably never use if you want to try something out. 

**October Game Update**
In case you missed it there were some cool things that came out from the patch notes this month (<https://swgr.org/post/update-1-1-1-0-the-last-update-before-jedi.2099/>). Few notables for me were getting rid of the dreaded Battle Fatigue, adding a new player tutorial, and upping them mission credit payouts. 

**Server Donations** - That time of the months again where folks start asking for donos (<https://opencollective.com/swgr>). Just FYI I joined the 1.2 Alpha testing for the Village  (join here https://discord.com/channels/109347519493914624/856355428598022144/1142197316749631538) and weâ€™re not really supposed to say much I guess but is progressing so thatâ€™s cool.

And remember - letâ€™s keep the big guy Jabba happy by keeping those spice lanes open <:jawahappy:1000974864443789454> Cheers-. Todays Date: Tuesday, Oct 24
