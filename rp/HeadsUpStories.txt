There has been a suspected Bounty Hunter hanging around the shuttleport in town. They might be looking for someone in the guild.
We are supposed to be receiving a shipment of supplies for the Shadow Market today. Its coming from Jabba’s Palace so there might be more scoundrels than normal in town today.
The cloning facility is getting a large shipment of bacta today. The delivery is being done by an outfit that is friendly with the Empire. Rebel leaning people should be extra careful when about town today.
The Rebel leaning militia members within Black Sand Mercs are meeting with several other Rebel cells today from other guilds. They will be somewhere out of the way in Mos Pelgo. Citizens that are sympathetic to the Empire should be careful today.
The Space Rack is receiving a shipment of random looted goods from some local mercenaries who operate out of the nearby dunes. Because of this there might be a few unsavory characters around the center of town today.
The Black Sand Mercenaries are expected to carry out a raid in a house towards the edge of town that is suspected to be harboring fugitives that Jabba is looking for. You may hear some loud commotion at some point.
There will be a few new plants planted in one of the gardens today. These are replacing some of the dead ones.
Some workers will be doing some repair work on the water lines on some of the side streets today. This should help the citizens that have been manually hauling water from the vaporators the past few days.
The Shadow Market is getting a deep clean today. It might be a little dustier than normal around lunch time.
There was a blaster shootout in the west side of town late last night. Although this isn’t rare, we've been seeing more of this lately.
